# Technology watch for Web developers

## What's "Technology Watch" and why should I be doing it ?

TODO

## I want to join the watch, where do I begin ?

Kamran Ahmed's [Web developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
  - Discover the landscape of modern Web development
  - Know where you are in your journey and what is next to learn
  - Be tempted by new branches ?
  
## Give yourself the means to succeed a productive watch !

- Choose a language / concept which drives you
- Impose yourself a daily ritual (one hour or more)
- Do not focus too much on one source, read / watch everything you can and cross-check the information
- Practice a lot, reading isn't enough, you have to jump in !
- Find someone who's as eager as you to learn some new skills, you will motivate and help each other

## I've assimilated a new skill and I'm ready to put it in practice, what now ?

Congratulations :) Now, prove it to yourself by teaching it to someone else (blog article, presentation to a team...)

## I feel like I've failed my learning...

First of all, you're wrong.

You may have chosen the wrong subject, failed in finding or understanding the resources, or even lost your motivation in the middle of the journey, it doesn't mean that it was all for nothing.

I am convinced that you've learned something new, something that you will need in the not too distant future.

And, who knows, you may just need some time to digest all the information gathered. Come back to the subject in a week or two, just in case !

## Conclusion

You really should start digging into technology watch, it will benefits to :
- Yourself, as you will learn new skills, 
- Your company, since you will be able to submit proposals based on your knowledge,
- Anyone impacted by the sharing that you may do after your learning !

What are you waiting for ? :)
